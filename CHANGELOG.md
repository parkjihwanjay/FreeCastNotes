# Changelog

All notable changes to FreeCast Notes are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-02-18

### Added

- **Preferences window** — Dedicated window for settings (⌘, or tray menu → Preferences). No longer an overlay; opens in a separate floating window so the note window stays open and in place.
- **Launch at login** — Option in Preferences to start FreeCast Notes when you log in (macOS login items).
- **Split layout** — Toggle between single editor and sidebar + editor view. Shortcut: **⌘S**. Title bar and traffic light (close button) span the full window in split mode; title and tags stay centered.
- **Format bar toggle** — Show/hide the format bar with **⌥⌘,** (Option+Command+Comma).

### Changed

- **Layout shortcut** — Toggle split layout changed from **⌘\\** to **⌘S**.
- **Export shortcut** — **⇧⌘E** now opens the command palette with the Export submenu focused (Markdown, HTML, plain text).
- **Preferences** — Vault folder, layout mode, sort order, and global shortcut are now in the Preferences window. Note count in Preferences loads correctly in the standalone window (vault list is fetched).
- **Window chrome** — Only the red (close) traffic light is shown; minimize and zoom buttons were removed. In split layout, the close button is at the top-left of the entire window (above the sidebar).
- **Toolbar and tags** — In the main window, note title and tags are on one line and centered together as a single unit.

### Fixed

- **Preferences note count** — Fixed "0 notes" in the Preferences vault section when opening Preferences in its own window; the app now loads the vault list there so the count is correct.
- **Format bar shortcut** — **⌥⌘,** now correctly toggles the format bar (no double-toggle).

### Removed

- **Export All Notes** — The "Export All Notes" action and its batch export flow were removed from the command palette and codebase.
